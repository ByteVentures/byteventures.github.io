      <description>What Does Unlocking Mean ? Here, unlocking means to get access to features that were locked (restricted) by the provider.In this case the provider is the ISP and not the manufacturer (Huawei).
Why Is Unlocking Necessary ? The Huawei B310s-927 is a very famous router provided by ISPs for mobile networks. Meaning, you could use a SIM card to get data and have access to features found in traditional routers. However the ISP modifies the router to only accept their SIM cards and not others&amp;rsquo;.</description>
